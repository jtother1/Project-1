# project-1
Started out just thinking about the game of hangman and each steps that need to be carried out for it to be fully functional.
so i wrote basic html and css added the buttons in html...to get the bones of the game so i could atleast get a better visual as im adding new features.
The technologies i used were mainly in the javascript 
-function update display character using a for loop to display correct letters in random word
-functions for updating the randomwords in reset using math to spit out random words
-function reset carries out most of the calls in order to reset the game after pressing play again button in the alert after first game-also uses for loopto redo the buttons already picked and letters from previous games back to default
-hangman image is created using query selector all to get the info for each of the 26 buttons created then is added to the buttons in the if statement for every time a wrong letter is chosen it will display in order a different picture of each stage of building the hangman
-buttons are made using query selectors and adding event listeners for click...if else statement is then created for the correct and wrong buttons


unsolved problems-media QUERY is not the best..
adding a player two option
